How do you do it?! 😜 From surviving my endless rants to reading my mind before I even speak, you’ve truly mastered the art of being the best sister and best friend all in one.
                            I still can’t believe how, in just 8 months, you’ve become the person who knows exactly when I’m on the verge of a breakdown. Thanks for always making sure I don’t fall apart and for being my personal therapist, fun dealer, and all-around lifesaver!
                            Wishing you a birthday as awesome as you are—filled with cake, laughter, and a year ahead full of the happiness and love you deserve. Let’s keep the chaos going! 🎂💖</p>
